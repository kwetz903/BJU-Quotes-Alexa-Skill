# BJU-Quotes-Alexa-Skill
this is an Alexa skill input I created for my Computer Science Seminar Class.
It is a lambda function that gives a quote from select current or past Faculty and Staff members of Bob Jones University.
If the user requests a quote from someone who the skill doesn't have a quote from, the skill will inform the user and proceed to give another quote.

There is no setup needed to use this skill besides enabling the Alexa Skill App on your device.
